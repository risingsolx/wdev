  <p>Hello. My name is Timothy Bathan. I'm an independent game designer and amateur front-end developer.
    When I'm not on my computer working, I'm at the gym working on my deadlift and bench press PR or out
    in the community experiencing a new board game. I look forward to meeting with you.

  <h3>Education & Work History</h3>
  <ul>
    <!--specifies what type of list. this is an unordered list-->
    <li> Bachelor's of Liberal Arts - Psychology</li>
    <!--this is a listed item (li). you nest a list within a list within a list etc. -->
    <ul>
      <!--list within a list -->
      <li>6 year degree in order to obtain the most useful/useless degree of my life.</li>
      <!--bullet description -->
    </ul>
    <li> 7 years professional experience in the mental health field</li>
    <ul>
      <li>After college, I spent the next 7 years working my way through the mental health field. I started out as a data entry
        clerk and receptionist and moved up by learning BST and PSR programs, etc. etc. Currently working as a special needs job
        coach and personally, it sucks. Its so mindnumbingly boring.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> 3 years experience in sales</li>
    <ul>
      <li>In my 3 years doing sales, I realized that it was fun when I could get people to by stuff from me and it sucked
        tremendously when i barely could make a commission or 6 year degree in order to obtain the most useful/useless degree of my life.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> professional party crasher/ photobooth host</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Basically, in some point in my life, I worked a job similar to "The Wedding Crashers". It was helluva lot of fun but definitely
        not a job I could keep as a growing professional. Saw some nice tits there too. </li>
    </ul>
    <li> Damn decent fellow and creative mind</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Always formal on the outside, I'm a bit rough in manners when you get to know me. I'm loyal unless you give me a reason not to be.
        Overall, I'm just looking to be proud of my work and happy with my progress. I want to stop living paycheck to paycheck or off my
        wife's salary. I want to be better for her, us, and me.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

          with various individuals. I also learned to manage clinical documents and meetings in order to best serve

  <h3>Some of my Favorite Stomping Grounds</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://humulos.com/digimon/">Digimon Hatchery</a></li> Because I enjoy taking care of digimon on my spare time.
    <!-- link tag. it looks like when you type outside of a list, it automatically places it in it's own paragraph-->
    <li><a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon</a></li> Because retail therapy is a terribly good thing.
    <li><a href="http://google.com">Google</a></li> Because who doesn't like Google and Google searching for stuff.
    <li><a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a></li> Because I can get lost in there for hours and not be bored.
